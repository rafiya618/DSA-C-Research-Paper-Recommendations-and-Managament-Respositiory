# DSA-C-Research-Paper-Recommendations-and-Managament-Respositiory
Research Repository Recommendation and Management System, a C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project designed to  interact with extensive repositories of research papers published by the faculty of university with interactive command line interface.
## FUNCTIONALITIES:
### Search Functionality:
-> Users can search for specific terms within research paper titles, and matching papers are displayed.<br>
### Author Search:
-> Users can search for research papers based on author names, providing a convenient way to locate papers by specific authors.<br>
### Recommendation System:
-> The system recommends papers based on matching keywords with the user's areas of interest.<br>
-> Recommendations are personalized and evolve over time by considering the user's view history.<br>
### Statistical Record:
-> Displays total counts of users (readers and authors) and research papers in the repository.<br>
### User View History:
-> Utilizes stacks to show recently viewed papers on top.<br>
-> Records the exact time and date of each viewing.<br>
-> Continuous improvement of recommendations based on the user's view history.<br>
## Data Structures Used:
-> Binary Trees and Traversals<br>
-> Stacks and Queues<br>
-> Arrays<br>
