# DSA-C-Research-Paper-Recommendations-and-Managament-Respositiory
Research Repository Recommendation and Management System, a C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project designed to  interact with extensive repositories of research papers published by the faculty of university with interactive command line interface.
## FUNCTIONALITIES:
### Search Functionality:
-> Users can search for specific terms within research paper titles, and matching papers are displayed.
### Author Search:
-> Users can search for research papers based on author names, providing a convenient way to locate papers by specific authors.
### Recommendation System:
-> The system recommends papers based on matching keywords with the user's areas of interest.
-> Recommendations are personalized and evolve over time by considering the user's view history.
### Statistical Record:
-> Displays total counts of users (readers and authors) and research papers in the repository.
### User View History:
-> Utilizes stacks to show recently viewed papers on top.
-> Records the exact time and date of each viewing.
-> Continuous improvement of recommendations based on the user's view history.
## Data Structures Used:
-> Binary Trees and Traversals
