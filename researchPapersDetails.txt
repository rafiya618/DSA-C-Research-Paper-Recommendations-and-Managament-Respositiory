Robust human activity recognition from depth video using spatiotemporal multi-fused features
1
2017
The recently developed depth imaging technologies have provided new directions for human activity recognition (HAR) without attaching optical markers or any other motion sensors to human body parts. In this paper, we propose novel multi-fused features for online human activity recognition (HAR) system that recognizes human activities from continuous sequences of depth map. The proposed online HAR system segments human depth silhouettes using temporal human motion information as well as it obtains human skeleton joints using spatiotemporal human body information. Then, it extracts the spatiotemporal multi-fused features that concatenate four skeleton joint features and one body shape feature. Skeleton joint features include the torso-based distance feature (DT), the key joint-based distance feature (DK), the spatiotemporal magnitude feature (M) and the spatiotemporal directional angle feature

A comprehensive security analysis of LEACH++ clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks
2
2019/4/1
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) will play a major role in future technologies in the development of the cyber-physical society. Studies show that WSNs are vulnerable to various insider attacks that may degrade its performance and affect the application services. Various intrusion detection system-based solutions have been proposed for WSNs to secure them from such attacks; however, these solutions have certain limitations with respect to completeness and evaluation. Recently, we proposed an intrusion detection framework to secure WSNs from insider attacks and proposed a protocol called LEACH++. In this paper, we perform a detailed security analysis of LEACH++ against black-hole, sink-hole and selective forwarding attacks by launching a number of attacks with different patterns.

Depth Images-based Human Detection, Tracking and Activity Recognition Using Spatiotemporal Features and Modified HMM
3
2016
Human activity recognition using depth information is an emerging and challenging technology in computer vision due to its considerable attention by many practical applications such as smart home/office system, personal health care and 3D video games. This paper presents a novel framework of 3D human body detection, tracking and recognition from depth video sequences using spatiotemporal features and modified HMM. To detect human silhouette, raw depth data is examined to extract human silhouette by considering spatial continuity and constraints of human motion information. While, frame differentiation is used to track human movements. Features extraction mechanism consists of spatial depth shape features and temporal joints features are used to improve classification performance. Both of these features are fused together to recognize different activities using the modified hidden Markov model (M-HMM). The proposed approach is evaluated on two challenging depth video datasets. Moreover, our system has significant abilities to handle subject's body parts rotation and body parts missing which provide major contributions in human activity recognition.

Performance analysis of peer-to-peer overlay architectures for Mobile Ad hoc Networks
4
2009/10/19
Mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) are good candidate for peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay architectures. In both, nodes work independently and are distributed in nature. P2P overlays are mostly built over traditional underlying IP network like Internet. There are two flavors of it; unstructured P2P such as Gnutella and structured P2P such as Chord. In this paper, we explain and evaluate Gnutella and Chord for different scenarios in NS-2 while keeping Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) as underlying routing protocol. Simulation results show that unstructured P2P architecture achieves high hit rate and produces less updates. We further investigate Gnutella by changing the underlying routing protocol.

Improved Behavior Monitoring and Classification Using Cues Parameters Extraction from Camera Array Images
5
2018
Behavior monitoring and classification is a mechanism used to automatically identify or verify individual based on their human detection, tracking and behavior recognition from video sequences captured by a depth camera. In this paper, we designed a system that precisely classifies the nature of 3D body postures obtained by Kinect using an advanced recognizer. We proposed novel features that are suitable for depth data. These features are robust to noise, invariant to translation and scaling, and capable of monitoring fast human bodyparts movements. Lastly, advanced hidden Markov model is used to recognize different activities. In the extensive experiments, we have seen that our system consistently outperforms over three depth-based behavior datasets, i.e., IM-DailyDepthActivity, MSRDailyActivity3D and MSRAction3D in both posture classification and behavior recognition. Moreover, our system handles subject's body parts rotation, self-occlusion and body parts missing which significantly track complex activities and improve recognition rate. Due to easy accessible, low-cost and friendly deployment process of depth camera, the proposed system can be applied over various consumer-applications including patient-monitoring system, automatic video surveillance, smart homes/offices and 3D games.

A Systematic Literature Review of 3D Deep Learning Techniques in Computed Tomography Reconstruction
6
2023/12/5
Computed tomography (CT) is used in a wide range of medical imaging diagnoses. However, the reconstruction of CT images from raw projection data is inherently complex and is subject to artifacts and noise, which compromises image quality and accuracy. In order to address these challenges, deep learning developments have the potential to improve the reconstruction of computed tomography images. In this regard, our research aim is to determine the techniques that are used for 3D deep learning in CT reconstruction and to identify the training and validation datasets that are accessible. This research was performed on five databases. After a careful assessment of each record based on the objective and scope of the study, we selected 60 research articles for this review. This systematic literature review revealed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs), and deep learning reconstruction (DLR) were the most suitable deep learning algorithms for CT reconstruction. Additionally, two major datasets appropriate for training and developing deep learning systems were identified: 2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo and MSCT. These datasets are important resources for the creation and assessment of CT reconstruction models. According to the results, 3D deep learning may increase the effectiveness of CT image reconstruction, boost image quality, and lower radiation exposure. By using these deep learning approaches, CT image reconstruction may be made more precise and effective, improving patient outcomes, diagnostic accuracy, and healthcare system productivity.

Depth video-based human activity recognition system using translation and scaling invariant features for life logging at smart home
7
2012/8
Video-based human activity recognition systems have potential contributions to various applications such as smart homes and healthcare services. In this work, we present a novel depth video-based translation and scaling invariant human activity recognition (HAR) system utilizing R transformation of depth silhouettes. To perform HAR in indoor settings, an invariant HAR method is critical to freely perform activities anywhere in a camera view without translation and scaling problems of human body silhouettes. We obtain such invariant features via R transformation on depth silhouettes. Furthermore, in R transforming depth silhouettes, shape information of human body reflected in depth values is encoded into the features. In R transformation, 2D feature maps are computed first through Radon transform of each depth silhouette followed by computing 1D feature profile through R transform to get the translation.

A novel intrusion detection framework for wireless sensor networks
8
2013/6
Vehicle cloud is a new idea that uses the benefits of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the concept of cloud computing to provide better services to the community. It is important to secure a sensor network to achieve better performance of the vehicle cloud. Wireless sensor networks are a soft target for intruders or adversaries to launch lethal attacks in its present configuration. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection framework is proposed for securing wireless sensor networks from routing attacks. The proposed system works in a distributed environment to detect intrusions by collaborating with the neighboring nodes. It works in two modes: online prevention allows safeguarding from those abnormal nodes that are already declared as malicious while offline detection finds those nodes that are being compromised by an adversary during the next epoch of time.

2006
Different methods containing biometric algorithms are presented for the representation of eigenfaces detection including face recognition, are identification and verification. Our theme of this research is to manage the critical processing stages (accuracy, speed, security and monitoring) of face activities with the flexibility of searching and edit the secure authorized database. In this paper we implement different techniques such as eigenfaces vector reduction by using texture and shape vector phenomenon for complexity removal, while density matching score with Face Boundary Fixation (FBF) extracted the most likelihood characteristics in this media processing contents. We examine the development and performance efficiency of the database by applying our creative algorithms in both recognition and detection phenomenon. Our results show the performance accuracy and security gain with better achievement than a number of previous approaches in all the above processes in an encouraging mode.

2020/4/22
One of the most important threats to today's civilization is terrorism. Terrorism not only disturbs the law and order situations in a society but also affects the quality of lives of humans and makes them suppressed physically and emotionally and deprives them of enjoying life. The more the civilizations have advanced, the more the people are working towards exploring different mechanisms to protect the mankind from terrorism. Different techniques have been used as counterterrorism to protect the lives of individuals in society and to improve the quality of life in general. Machine learning methods have been recently explored to develop techniques for counterterrorism based on artificial intelligence (AI). Since deep learning has recently gained more popularity in machine learning domain, in this paper, these techniques are explored to understand the behavior of terrorist activities. Five different models based on deep neural network (DNN) are created to understand the behavior of terrorist activities such as is the attack going to be successful or not? Or whether the attack is going to be suicide or not? Or what type of weapon is going to be used in the attack? Or what type of attack is going to be carried out? Or what region is going to be attacked? The models are implemented in single-layer neural network (NN), five-layer DNN, and three traditional machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, SVM, and Na�ve Bayes.

A comprehensive framework to quantify fault tolerance metrics of web centric mobile applications
12
2017/4/19
Applications well-defined with high Fault Tolerance index are considered reliable and trustworthy to drive quality. Fault Tolerance metrics for web mobile applications are neither defined formally nor are they organized at a single place for measurement to researchers and quality engineers. Fault Tolerance metrics determines the quality of web mobile applications provided they are measured accurately. There is a phenomenal gap between Fault Tolerance (FT) metrics development and measurement for web based mobile applications. Unfortunately, existing research has failed in providing a precise and well-organized definition for Fault Tolerance metrics in the domain of web mobile applications. This has led to inadequate Fault Tolerance metrics to perfectly measure and benchmark modern day web mobile applications.

Data Transmission and Capacity over Efficient IoT Energy Consumption
13
2019/12
The research on preserving energy resources to increase Internet of Things (IoT) device lifespan in the remote areas has high precedence. The energy consumption in an IoT network is mostly affected by the volume and processing requirements for the data transformation. Theretofore, the constrained network and constrained devices have different design and performance to be considered in energy performance of an IoT system. In this research, the power consumption with regards to the capacity of the memory and the data transmission is analyzed. It is assumed that the location and specifications of the constrained IoT device have an effect over the network and devices performance. One of the performance metrics is the energy consumption with regards to the data size, storage, processing and transmission with respect to the device location, processing power and storage capacity. This research intends to present a model of power requirement for the specific specifications of IoT devices in different network topologies.

Application profiling from encrypted traffic
14
2021/11
Everyday millions of people use Internet for various purposes including information access, communication, business, education, entertainment and more. As a result, huge amount of information is exchanged between billions of connected devices. This information can be encapsulated in different types of data packets. This information is also referred to as network traffic. The traffic analysis is a challenging task when the traffic is encrypted and the contents are not readable. So complex algorithms required to deduce the information and form patterns for traffic analysis. Many of currently available techniques rely on application specific attribute analysis, deep packet inspection (DPI) or content-based analysis that become ineffective on encrypted traffic. The article will focused on analysis techniques for encrypted traffic that are adaptive to address the evolving nature and increasing volume of network traffic.

Channel contention-based routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks
15
2021/1/20
With the development of wireless technology, two basic wireless network models that are commonly used, known as infrastructure and wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs), have been developed. In the literature, it has been observed that channel contention is one of the main reasons for packet drop in WANETs. To handle this problem, this paper presents a routing protocol named CCBR (Channel Contention Based Routing). CCBR tries to determine a least contended path between the endpoints to increase packet delivery ratio and to reduce packet delay and normalized routing overhead. Moreover, throughout the active data section, each intermediate node computes its channel contention value. If an intermediate node detects an increase in channel contention, it notifies the source node. Then the source node determines another least contended route for transmission.
